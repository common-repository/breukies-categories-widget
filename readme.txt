== Frequently Asked Questions ==

<em>I ticked the checkbox for the "Show Option All" parameter, but I see no change?</em>
<ul>
	<li>As of WordPress version 2.1 this parameter does not have any effect on your Categorie display yet. I included this parameter allready so it wil work as soon as this parameter is or will be in full use.</li>
</ul>
<em>I ticked the checkbox for the "Hierarchy" parameter, but I also want to use the "Child off" parameter?</em>
<ul>
	<li>It is not possible to use those two parameters at the same time in the same instance. Ticking the checkbox for the "Hierarchy" parameter will allways switch off the "Child off" parameter, whatever you set it to. If you think of it, it is actually very logical. The "Child off" parameter only displays categories that are children of the category identified by its ID.</li>
</ul>
<em>I use the "Child off" parameter, but I now also see categories with no posts?</em>
<ul>
	<li>If the "Child off" parameter is used, the "Hide Empty" parameter will be set to false automatically by the wp_list_categories function. It will show you specific children of the category, but If there are no posts in a parent Category, the parent Category will not display</li>
</ul>
<em>I use the "Child off" parameter, but I don't see any categories?</em>
<ul>
	<li>The "Child off" parameter will show you specific children of a specific category, but if there are no posts in a parent category, the parent category will not be displayed</li>
</ul>
